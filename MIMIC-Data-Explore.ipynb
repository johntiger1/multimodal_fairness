Again seen are small bilateral hyperdense\\ncollections layering within the occipital horns. There is\\npersistent effacement of the cortical sulci. The ventricular\\nsystem is unchanged in size and configuration. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter\\ndifferentiation is preserved. There is no evidence of acute\\nterritorial infarction. Again noted is a mucous retention cyst\\nin the right maxillary sinus. There is mild mucosal thickening\\ninvolving both maxillary sinuses and several bilateral ethmoid\\nair cells. No evidence of fracture.\\nCTA HEAD: The vertebral arteries are codominant and patent.\\nThere is a 2.5 mm outpouching of the V4 segment of the left\\nvertebral artery which may involve the PICA origin (image 188\\nseries 2; image 26 series 300b,image 21 series 301b). There is\\npossible infundibular dilatation or ectasia involving the\\nbasilar artery at the origins of the superior cerebellar\\narteries. The intracranial internal carotid, anterior, middle,\\nand posterior cerebral arteries are patent without evidence of\\nocclusion, high-grade stenosis, aneurysm, or arteriovenous\\nmalformation. No additional aneurysms are identified.\\nCTA NECK:\\nThe origins of the great vessels at the level of the aortic arch\\nare\\nunremarkable. The paired vertebral arteries are patent in their\\nentirety.\\nAgain seen is the 2.5 mm outpouching involving the V4 segment of\\nthe left\\nvertebral artery. The extracranial common, internal, and\\nexternal carotid\\narteries are normal in course and caliber without evidence of\\nhigh-grade\\nstenosis or occlusion. There are dependent atelectatic changes,\\nleft greater than right. There are mild degenerative changes of\\nthe cervical spine, most pronounced at C5-6.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. 2.5 mm outpouching of the V4 segment of the left vertebral\\nartery which\\nmay involve the PICA origin.\\n2. Stable extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage with mild\\ndilatation of the lateral ventricles, unchanged since the prior\\nexamination.\\n\\n[**2193-2-20**] CT brain\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\n1. Mild increase in ventricular size following drain clamping.\\n\\n2. Evolving SAH and left PICA aneurysm clip.\\n\\n3. Persistent left parietal hyperdensity likely represents a\\nvascular\\nmalformation. MR can be ordered for further characterization.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nPatient began experiencing a sever headache and vomiting and\\npresented to OSH on [**2193-2-11**] and was found to have SAH on CT with\\na basilar tip aneurysm.  She was trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for\\nfurther management.  She was lethargic but arousable and\\nfollowing simple commands upon presentation.  Due to her CT\\nresults an EVD was emergently placed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  She was\\nstarted on Nimodopine for vasospasm prohylaxis and on the\\nmorning of [**2193-2-12**] she underwent cerebral angiogram which showed\\na left PICA aneurysm which was subsequently coiled. After the\\nangiogram she was transferred to the ICU where she was placed on\\nvasospasm watch.\\n\\nShe remained stable in the ICU and her exam slowly improved.  On\\n[**2-13**] she was awake and oriented to her self, location, and date\\nand strength was full but was slightly lethargic and a language\\nbarrier was present as she is spanish speaking only.  On [**2193-2-15**]\\nher exam remained stable and she was much more awake and\\ninteractive with the exam.  Her EVD was raised to 25. On\\n[**2193-2-16**] it was noted that EVD was slightly pulled out on\\nimaging thus resecured with staples. On [**2193-2-17**] the EVD was\\nclamped at 10am and began to experience ICP recordings in the\\n20's, max was 38- EVD was reopened. She had a second clamping\\ntrial and the EVD was successfully removed on [**2-21**]. In the\\nafternoon, it was noted that CSF was draining from the EVD site\\nin which staples and dermabond was used to close the incision\\nmore accurately. It was unsuccessful, CSF continued to drain\\nfrom the site and sutures were placed to create better closure\\nof incision. Patient was asked to cough and no CSF was observed.\\n\\n\\nPatient was again evaluated by PT for stairs, and they\\ndetermined over the weekend that she was not yet ready to be\\ndischarged to home where she has 3 flights of stairs to climb.\\nTHey reevaluated the patient on monday, [**2193-2-25**] and found that\\nshe was safe for discharge - she agrees with the plan.
